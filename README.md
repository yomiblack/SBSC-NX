# AI Chat Widget — Angular + Next.js (NX Monorepo)

This is a fullstack AI-powered chat widget built using **Angular**, **Next.js**, and **NX** in a monorepo architecture. It features a seamless UI, smart message streaming from Hugging Face (used instead of OpenAI due to quota limits), and MongoDB for persistent(just user) chat history, to manage memory.

## 🧠 Features

- 💬 AI chat powered by Hugging Face (streamed response)
- ⚙️ Angular-based chat widget with state management
- 🔁 Live two-way conversation with contextual history
- 🗂 Fullstack NX monorepo: shared code in `libs/`
- 🌐 Deployed on Vercel (single-unit build)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 19 (Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Next.js 15+ API Routes (App Router)
- **AI Model**: Hugging Face (text-generation)
- **Database**: MongoDB via Mongoose
- **Tooling**: NX Workspace, TypeScript, Vercel
